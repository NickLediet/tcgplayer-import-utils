 - get GH CLI installed
 - initialize the project. SIMPLE 0.0.1 NODE POC.

## FOR LATER
- Can't install GH CLI => Need to fix my fucked manjaro packages
- Make the curor a better color in vim.  It's invisible

always remeber

- the goal is just proving the concept not getting in the weeds of tooling or optimizing

proof of concept 
- [ ] Setup a tests directory (tests are going to be needed so we aren't so in the weeds immediately)
	- __tests__
	- /__mocks__
- [ ] Look at the TCG player exports
- [ ] Figure out how to map the data (Name & Set, or ID IDK)
- [ ] Get a list of Scryfall IDs
- [ ] Make a new deliverable
